# Kelp integration with Tinybird Starter Kit

Example application showcasing how Kelp can be used to build a real-time dashboard on top of Tinybird, for an eCommerce demo application. This app allows you to track the status of orders in real-time, from placement to shipping and delivery, ultimately leading to better order management and improved customer satisfaction.

## Setup

1. Setup your Tinybird account

Click this button to deploy the data project to Tinybird üëá

[![Deploy to Tinybird](https://cdn.tinybird.co/button)](https://ui.tinybird.co/workspaces/new?name=kelp_tinybird_demo)

Follow the guided process, and your Tinybird workspace is now ready to start receiving events.

1. Setup this repository locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinybirdco/kelp-tinybird-demo.git
cd kelp-tinybird-demo
```

2. Create an Upstash or Confluent Kafka Account

This demo uses [Upstash](https://upstash.com/) as a managed Kafka provider, but you can also use [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/). If you use Confluent Cloud, you will need to update the `config.json` file with your credentials.

3. Install dependencies

This script will automatically install and configure the `tinybird-cli` for this project.

```bash
npm install
```

Choose your region: 1 for `us-east`, 2 for `eu`. A new `.tinyb` file will be created.

Go to [https://ui.tinybird.co/tokens](https://ui.tinybird.co/tokens) and copy the token with admin rights.

‚ö†Ô∏èWarning! The Admin token, the one you copied following this guide, is your admin token. Don't share it or publish it in your application. You can manage your tokens via API or using the Auth Tokens section in the UI. More detailed info at [Auth Tokens management](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/api-reference/token-api.html)

1. Start sending data to Kafka.
2.

```bash
npm run start
```

1. Go to your [Tinybird workspace](https://ui.tinybird.co) and check the data is flowing.
